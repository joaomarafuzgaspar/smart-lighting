# Smart Lighting

This repository contains a networked real-time control system for a distributed illumination model of an office environment. Each desk is served by a smart luminaire mounted overhead, equipped with a light-emitting diode (LED), a light-dependent resistor (LDR) for measuring reflected light, and a presence sensor for occupancy detection. The system is implemented using Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers and CAN-BUS communication. Designed within a scaled, opaque cardboard box model, the project simulates coordinated dimming control to maximize user comfort and minimize energy consumption through decentralized, cooperative control algorithms.
